# Push notifications on 'Wusool' program

The goal of this project is to reduce the percentage of qualified cases to make them effective cases by reminding them to start using the program by one of the most important methods to maintain customer activity, which is push notifications.

In this graph it shows the percentages of qualified cases that have not started using the program compared to the effective cases, and I found that the percentage of qualified cases is 35%.
The next step I will identify all qualified  cases and send reminder notifications, and also I will identify cases that use the program continuously and effectively and send notifications It contains encouragement and motivation.
And identify the most and least used cities or regions to try to communicate and spread the “Wusool” program to large cities that have a small percentage of program users.
